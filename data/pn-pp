It is generally dated to around 1310. The painting has a traditional Christian subject, representing the Virgin Mary and the Christ Child seated on her lap, with saints surrounding the two. It is celebrated often as the first painting of the Renaissance due to its newfound naturalism and escape from the constraints of Gothic art.",

         "description" : "Painted during the latter part of Giotto's career, the Madonna and Child was the central part of a five-section polyptych, or altarpiece in many panels (see Reconstruction). Giotto utilized a conservative Byzantine-style background in gold leaf, symbolizing the realm of heaven, and included a white rose, the traditional symbol of Mary's purity as well as a reference to the innocence lost through Original Sin. Yet, the Madonna and Child introduces a new naturalistic trend in painting. Instead of making the blessing gesture of a philosopher, the infant Christ grasps his mother's left index finger in a typically baby-like way as he playfully reaches for the flower that she holds.",

         "description" : "The Arnolfini Portrait is an oil painting on oak panel dated 1434 by the Early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck. The painting is a small full-length double portrait, which is believed to represent the Italian merchant Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini and possibly his wife, presumably in their home in the Flemish city of Bruges. It is considered one of the more original and complex paintings in Western art because of the iconography, the unusual geometric orthogonal perspective, the use of the mirror to reflect the space, and that the portrait is considered unique by some art historians as the record of a marriage contract in the form of a painting.",

In Arras, van Eyck created a silverpoint drawing (Dresden, Staatliche Kunstsammlungen, Kupferstichkabinett), which most probably depicts the cardinal. Here the Flemish painter not only captured the physiognomy of the aged cleric but in his notes also specified the coloration.",

         "description" : "Today this Crucifixion scene is spread across a winged altar, but it was probably originally a single panel, with the frame only painted on to it. Not long after it was created, however, the work was sawn into three parts, making the portraits of St. Mary Magdalene and St. Veronica wings of a triptych. Given its original condition, it makes van der Weyden's artistic innovation even more significant: for the first time he unites all of the participants- the Crucifixion group, saints and the donors - in front of a continuous landscape, in which an idealised Jerusalem appears on the horizon. The realism of such a unified space had never been attempted in earlier works. Unknown today, the patrons are separated only by a conspicuous fissure in the ground from the central subject of religious contemplation, a concept that was so progressive that it was initially attenuated in the paintings of the period that followed.",

         "description" : "The subject is taken from a 6th-century legend of Greek origin, according to which St Luke was the first ever to draw a portrait of the Virgin Mary. Artists saw Luke as the patron of their art. Rogier van der Weyden set the action in an open loggia. To the left, at the foot of a throne, sits the Virgin, feeding the Christ Child. The throne, hinting at her future status as the Queen of Heaven, is decorated with sculptural figures of Adam and Eve, indicating that Christ and the Virgin will atone for their Original Sin. Opposite the Madonna, St Luke has sunk respectfully to his knees as he seeks to capture her appearance. The artist manages to convey both Luke's trembling reverence and his concentration on his drawing. Behind St Luke we can just see a bull and a book, both traditional attributes of the Apostle Luke. Two figures contemplating the landscape from the battlements possibly represent Joachim and Anna, the Virgin's parents.",

Its dating to Piero della Francesca's early career is evidenced by the strong relationship with the \"light painting\" of his master, Domenico Veneziano. It portrays Christ being baptised by John, his head surmounted by a dove representing the Holy Spirit. Christ, John's hand, the bird and the bowl form an axis which divides the painting in two symmetrical parts. A second division is created by the tree on the left, which instead divides it according to the golden ratio.",

A 1492 inventory of Lorenzo de' Medici's estate possibly identifies this picture as the most valuable in the collection of the powerful Florentine family, and attributes it to Fra Angelico. The Adoration of the Magi actually appears to be the product of two artists; Fra Angelico may only have started the altarpiece, the greatest part of the work having been taken up by Fra Filippo Lippi.",

         "description" : "The Adoration of the Magi is a painting by the Italian Renaissance master Sandro Botticelli, dating from 1475 or 1476. It is housed in the Uffizi of Florence. Botticelli was commissioned to paint at least seven versions of The Adoration of the Magi. The Adoration of the Magi theme was popular in the Renaissance Florence. The work was commissioned by Gaspare di Zanobi del Lama, a banker of humble origins and dubious morality connected to the House of Medici, for his chapel in the church of Santa Maria Novella (now destroyed). In the scene are present numerous characters among which are several members of the Medici family: Cosimo de' Medici (the Magus kneeling in front of the Virgin, described by Vasari as \"the finest of all that are now extant for its life and vigour\"), his sons Piero (the second Magus kneeling in the centre with the red mantle) and Giovanni (the third Magus), and his grandsons Giuliano and Lorenzo. The three Medici portrayed as Magi were all dead at the time the picture was painted, and Florence was effectively ruled by Lorenzo.",

It is also \"one of the most written about, and most controversial paintings in the world.\" While most critics agree that the painting, depicting a group of mythological figures in a garden, is allegorical for the lush growth of Spring, other meanings have also been explored. Among them, the work is sometimes cited as illustrating the ideal of Neoplatonic love. The painting itself carries no title and was first called La Primavera by the art historian Giorgio Vasari who saw it at Villa Castello, just outside Florence, in 1550.",

         "description" : "Venus and Mars is a c. 1483 painting by the Italian Renaissance master Sandro Botticelli. It shows the Roman gods Venus and Mars in an allegory of Beauty and Valour. Venus watches Mars sleep while two infant satyrs play carrying his armour as another rests under his arm. A fourth blows a small conch shell in his ear in an effort to wake him. The scene is set in a forest, and the background shows, in the distance, the sea from which Venus emerged. A swarm of wasps hover around Mars' head, possibly as a symbol that love is often accompanied by pain. Another possible explanation is that the wasps represent the Vespucci family that may have commissioned the painting; the symbol of the Vespucci house is the wasp. The painting is thought originally to have been the back of a lettuccio, a wooden sofa.",

It has been housed in the Museo del Prado in Madrid since 1939. Dating from between 1490 and 1510, when Bosch was between about 40 and 60 years old, it is his best-known and most ambitious complete work. It reveals the artist at the height of his powers; in no other painting does he achieve such complexity of meaning or such vivid imagery.",

         "description" : "The Portrait of Francesco delle Opere is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist Perugino, dating to 1494 and housed in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence. Francesco delle Opere is portrayed from three-quarters, with a black beret and a mantle of the same color, a red blouse under which is a white shirt. His hand holds a cartouche with the words Timete Devm (\"Beware of God\"), the beginning of a famous preaching by Girolamo Savonarola. The hands lie on an invisible parapet which coincides with the painting's lower border, as in Flemish contemporary works such as Hans Memling's Man with a Letter.",

Bosch's picture emphasises the contrast between the brutality of the tormentors and the mild, suffering Christ. Its emotional intensity is achieved in a variety of ways. The half-length figures create a sense of proximity, and the lack of recession in the painting makes it appear very claustrophobic. From the centre of the picture Christ seems to appeal to us to share in his suffering.",

It was acquired by King Francis I of France and is now the property of the French Republic, on permanent display at the Musee du Louvre in Paris since 1797. The ambiguity of the subject's expression, which is frequently described as enigmatic, the monumentality of the composition, the subtle modeling of forms and the atmospheric illusionism were novel qualities that have contributed to the continuing fascination and study of the work.",

         "description" : "The Virgin of the Rocks (sometimes the Madonna of the Rocks) is the name used for two paintings by Leonardo da Vinci, of the same subject, and of a composition which is identical except for several significant details. The version generally considered the prime version, that is the earlier of the two, hangs in the Musee du Louvre in Paris and the other in the National Gallery, London. The paintings are both nearly 2 metres (over 6 feet) high and are painted in oils. Both were painted on wooden panel; that in the Louvre has been transferred to canvas. Both paintings show the Madonna and Christ Child with the infant John the Baptist and an angel, in a rocky setting which gives the paintings their usual name. The significant compositional differences are in the gaze and right hand of the angel. There are many minor ways in which the works differ, including the colours, the lighting, the flora, and the way in which sfumato has been used.

The Virgin Mary is shown in a contrapposto pose, wearing a gold-bordered blue mantle set against a red dress and with her right leg lying along a diagonal. The blue symbolizes the church and the red Christ's death, with the Madonna the uniting of Mother Church with Christ's sacrifice. With her eyes fixed on Christ, her head is turned to the left and slightly inclined, and in her hands she holds up Christ, as he leans forward unsteadily to touch the miniature cross held by John. The poppy refers to Christ's passion, death and resurrection.",

The sandy hair of the unknown woman is held at the back of the head by a shining golden net, the prevailing fashion in Venice. Durer has used carefully distributed highlights to emphasise the curly hair falling to either side of the face; it has a formal counterpart in the fine ribbons of her dress. The fact that Durer left the preparatory underdrawing of the ribbon on the left has led to the assumption that the picture is unfinished, but technical analysis of the entire surface of the painting speaks against it. It makes sense from a compositional point of view: the colour of the one ribbon matches the woman's hair, while the other picks up the monochrome tone of the background and is also found in the young woman's dark eyes.",

Now in the Uffizi in Florence, Italy, and still in its original frame, the painting was probably commissioned by Agnolo Doni to commemorate his marriage to Maddalena Strozzi, the daughter of a powerful Tuscan family. The painting is in the form of a tondo, or round frame, which is frequently associated during the Renaissance with domestic ideas. The work was most likely created during the period after the Doni's marriage in 1503 or 1504, as well as after the excavation of the Laocoon about 1506, yet before the Sistine Chapel ceiling frescoes were begun in 1508, dating the painting to approximately late 1506 or 1507. The Doni Tondo features the Christian Holy family (the child Jesus, Mary, and Saint Joseph) along with John the Baptist in the foreground and contains five ambiguous nude male figures in the background. The inclusion of these nude figures has been interpreted in a variety of ways.",

         "description" : "The Creation of Adam is arguably the most famous section of Michelangelo's fresco Sistine Chapel ceiling painted circa 1511-1512. It is traditionally thought to illustrate the Biblical creation narrative from the Book of Genesis in which God breathes life into Adam, the first man. Chronologically the fourth in the series of panels depicting episodes from Genesis on the Sistine ceiling, it was among the last to be completed. It is the most well-known of the Sistine Chapel fresco panels, and its fame as a piece of art is rivaled only by the Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci. The image of the near-touching hands of God and Adam has become one of the single most iconic images of humanity and has been reproduced in countless imitations and parodies. Along with Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper, The Creation of Adam and the other Sistine Chapel panels are the most replicated religious paintings of all time.",

It depicts Mary embracing the child Christ, while the young John the Baptist devoutly watches. Painted during his Roman period, this Madonna does not have the strict geometrical form and linear style of his earlier Florentine treatments of the same subject. Instead, the warmer colors seem to suggest the influence of Titian and Raphael's rival Sebastiano del Piombo.",

         "description" : "Flora is an oil painting by Italian late Renaissance painter Titian, dated to around 1515 and now held at the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. The work was reproduced in numerous 16th century etchings. It portrays an idealized beautiful woman, a model established in the Venetian school by Titian's master Giorgione with his Laura. Her left hands holds a pink-shaded mantle, while another holds a handful of flowers and leaves. The meaning of the painting is disputed: some, basing for example to inscriptions added to the 16th century reproductions, identifies the woman as a courtesan; other consider it a symbol of nuptial love, although her dress is not a dressing one. The identification with Flora, the ancient goddess of Spring and vegetation, derives from the presence of Spring flowers in her hands.",

Bindo Altoviti was a rich banker born in Rome in 1491, but of Florentine origin. He was a cultured man who loved the arts. The graceful, almost effeminate position of the subject along with the heavy contrast between light and shadow are atypical of Raphael's work, particularly of his portraits of men, demonstrating the artist's experimentation with different styles and forms in his later Roman period. The influence of the works of Leonardo, which Raphael studied astutely during this period of his career, are strikingly evident in this particular piece.",

She is sitting on a bench that has been covered with a precious carpet, and behind her is a dark-green surface on which a mirror has been hung. On the left a view of a Venetian landscape gives the painting depth. By using the same colours in the principal motif and landscape, Bellini connects the two spheres, and the basic mood of the painting is gentle and unified. In her right hand the young woman is holding another mirror, which is a symbol of vanitas on the one hand and an attribute of Venus Pudica on the other. Using the device of two mirrors, Bellini enables the observer to see two views of the woman's head from a single vantage point, a perspective possible only in painting.",

It is one of a cycle of paintings on mythological subjects produced for Alfonso d'Este, the Duke of Ferrara, for the Camerino d'Alabastro - a private room in his palazzo in Ferrara decorated with paintings based on classical texts. An advance payment was given to Raphael, who originally held the commission for the subject of a Triumph of Bacchus. At the time of Raphael's death in 1520, only a preliminary drawing was completed and the commission was then handed to Titian. In the case of Bacchus and Ariadne, the subject matter was derived from the Roman poets Catullus and Ovid. The painting, considered one of Titian's greatest works, now hangs in the National Gallery in London.",

The sitter is not known, but he must have belonged to Bronzino's close circle of literary friends in Florence, a number of whom sat for the artist. Bronzino himself composed verses in the style of the great Florentine poet Petrarch (1304-74), and the fanciful and witty details in this picture: the carved grotesque heads on the table and chair and the masklike face suggested in the folds of the youth's breeches would have been appreciated by writers as comments on masks and identity. The book is doubtless a collection of poems. For a technical study of the changes Bronzino made to the painting as he worked see metmuseum.org/collections.",

         "description" : "The Venus of Urbino is a 1538 oil painting by the Italian master Titian. It depicts a nude young woman, identified with the goddess Venus, reclining on a couch or bed in the sumptuous surroundings of a Renaissance palace. It hangs in the Galleria degli Uffizi in Florence. The figure's pose is based on Giorgione's Sleeping Venus (c. 1510), which Titian completed. In this depiction, Titian has domesticated Venus by moving her to an indoor setting, engaging her with the viewer, and making her sensuality explicit. Devoid as it is of any classical or allegorical trappings - Venus displays none of the attributes of the goddess she is supposed to represent - the painting is unapologetically erotic.",

One of his most famous works, it is housed in the Uffizi Gallery of Florence, Italy and is considered one of the preeminent examples of Mannerist portraiture. The painting depicts Eleanor of Toledo, the wife of Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, sitting with her hand resting on the shoulder of one of her sons. This gesture, as well as the pomegranate motif on her dress, referred to her role as mother. Eleanor wears a heavily brocaded dress with black arabesques. In this pose, she is depicted as the ideal woman of the Renaissance.",

         "description" : "Completely in contrast to the principles of Venetian painting, which made colour the dominant means of expression, Renaissance painting in Florence gave priority to the drawing as the means of expressing artistic invention. Thus there was a demand that the contours in painting be dear and sometimes even sharp. Bronzino's works are considered the epitome of Florentine disegno and, at the same time, its final pinnacle, which had already assumed the character of Mannerism. Bronzino, who was a pupil of Jacopo Pontormo and thus extremely familiar with the works of Michelangelo, served for many years as court painter to the Medici. He created decorations (now lost) for numerous theatrical works and festive occasions and supplied brilliant designs for the Medici tapestry factory. In his composition Bronzino organises the group in close proximity to one another in the foreground. Nevertheless the figures are arranged next to and behind each other in a way that makes them easy to recognise. The infant St. John is in the foremost position, his gaze and gesture pointing to the infant Jesus, who is depicted frontally. Behind them stands St. Mary, who is holding her son's arm in a loving gesture. The composition is extended by St. Anne and St. Joseph, who stand out from the central group of three because of their more natural skin colour. More than in almost any other of his works, Bronzino has emphasised the sharply outlined and sculptural figures almost to the point of stony coldness, especially in the case of the two boys. This artistic decision is also an example of paragone (Italian: comparison) - the competition, discussed in art theory at the time, between painting and sculpture to see which could create the better depiction of three-dimensional forms. Here Bronzino creates exciting contrasts: the coolness and clarity of his composition as opposed to the intimate familiar atmosphere; soft and gentle movements contrasted with formal severity and abstraction; turning away from natural models on the one hand but depicting all of their details on the other.",

In some areas, the artist even painted with his finger, as seen in Adonis's arm. The composition's dynamism springs from the torsion caused by Venus's awkward pose, which was inspired by an ancient sculptural relief. Titian used rich colors, shimmering highlights, and a lush landscape to create the painting's evocative, poignant mood.",

Their catch is poor: a single fox dangling from the spear the hunter on the left carries on his shoulder. To the hunter's left, Bruegel added a motif that had been used for quite some time in book illumination for depicting the month of December: the preparations for singeing a pig over an open fire outside a building. The damaged sign hanging above them reveals the name of the inn: \"To the Deer\" a well-aimed passing shot. Entertaining details, such as the people ice-skating on the frozen lakes, have contributed to the painting's enormous popularity.",

We can already see the elements of the artist's style which were to have such a widespread influence on other artists. The figure of a young boy dressed in a white shirt stands out clearly against the dark background. The sharp sidelighting and the falling shadows give the objects an almost tangible volume and weight. Caravaggio was interested in the uniqueness of the surrounding world, and there are markedly individual features not only in the youth's face but also in the objects which make up the still life: the damaged pear, the crack in the lute, the crumpled pages of the music. The melody written on those pages is that of a then fashionable song by Jacques Arcadelt, \"You know that I love you\". Love as the theme of this work is also indicated by other objects. For instance, the cracked lute was a metaphor for the love that fails,.",

Along with Vincent van Gogh's The Starry Night, some landscapes by William Turner, and some works by Monet, it is among the best known depictions of the sky in Western art, and features sharp color contrast between the sky and the hills below. Painted in a Mannerist (or Baroque) style, the work takes liberties with the actual layout of Toledo (some buildings are depicted in different positions than their actual location, but truthfully depicts on the side the Castle of San Servando).",

In 1599 he became Inquisitor General of Spain but resigned in 1602 to serve the rest of his life as Archbishop of Seville. The painting probably dates from the spring of 1600 when the cardinal was in Toledo with Philip III and members of the Madrid court. El Greco had lived in Venice and in the Farnese Palace in Rome, where Titian's portraits (such as those of the Farnese Pope Paul III) would have revealed to the Greek painter the psychological possibilities of portraiture.",

         "description" : "The Supper at Emmaus is a painting by the Italian Baroque master Caravaggio, and now in the National Gallery in London. The painting depicts the moment when the resurrected but incognito Jesus, reveals himself to two of his disciples (presumed to be Luke and Cleopas), only to soon vanish from their sight. Cleopas wears the scallopshell of a pilgrim. The other apostle wears torn clothes. Cleopas gesticulates in a perspectively-challenging extension of arms in and out of the frame of reference. The standing groom, forehead smooth and face in darkness, appears oblivious to the event. The painting is unusual for the life-sized figures, the dark and blank background. The table lays out a still-life meal. The basket of food teeters perilously over the edge.",

         "description" : "As Homer tells it in The Iliad, Paris the shepherd, son of Priam, had to decide with of the three goddesses -Juno, Venus or Minerva- was the most beautiful, and give her the golden apple Mercury he had received from Mercury. On the left, Paris appears to be meditating, with the apple still in his hands. His attention is focused on Venus, in the middle of the composition. Minerva's weapons are visible in the foreground. The setting and elegance of this work bear a clear relation to southern painting as a result of the artist's stay in Italy. The figures are based on classical sculptures and the influence of mannerist painting is visible in the sinuous rhythm of their anatomies. This work was first documented at Madrid's Alcaízar Palace in 1666.",
         "excerpt" : "As Homer tells it in The Iliad, Paris the shepherd, son of Priam, had to decide with of the three goddesses -Juno, Venus or Minerva- was the most beautiful, and give her the golden apple Mercury he had received from Mercury.",

         "description" : "Isolated atop a mountain, a gaunt, tormented Christ dominates a nearly empty landscape. On a road leading to the walled city of Jerusalem, horsemen pass by the execution hill, literally turning their backs on Christ. El Greco's use of dramatic colors and exaggerated proportions distorts the figure, conveying the transcendent moment when Christ sublimated his physical pain and commended his spirit to God. Turning his eyes upward toward heaven, Christ looks away from the bones and skulls that lie at his feet, representative of his triumph over death. Light plays across his undulating form, illuminating his tortured body against the dark background. To heighten empathy between the viewer and Christ, the elongated but graceful figure appears alone. This private, devotional image was meant to encourage contemplation and spiritual reflection.",

         "description" : "Judith Slaying Holofernes is a painting by the Italian early Baroque artist Artemisia Gentileschi completed between 1611-12. The work shows an apocrypha scene from the Old Testament Book of Judith which details the delivery of Israel from the Assyrian general Holofernes. In this scene, Judith and her maidservant behead the general after he has fallen asleep drunk. The painting is relentlessly physical, from the wide spurts of blood to the energy of the two women as they try to wield the large dagger. The effort of the women's struggle is most finely represented by the delicate face of the maid, which is grasped by the oversized, muscular fist of Holofernes as he desperately struggles to survive. Although the painting depicts a classic scene from the Bible, Gentileschi drew herself as Judith and her mentor Agostino Tassi, who was tried in court for her rape, as Holofernes.",

Francis Xavier dominates the scene as the 'missionary to the Asian peoples', his left hand pointing to Fides, the personification of faith, his right hand extended towards the toppling idols, and his gaze turned to the listeners and supplicants. Rubens has used dramatic lighting to stage the group of listeners and observers, who, keeping a respectful distance, are bathed in bright light. Standing in the shadows the armoured soldier creates an optical turning point in the composition, leading the gaze of the viewer to the actual miracle depicted: in the left foreground deathly pale figures are rising from their graves.",

The wide expanse of fabric, spectacularly rendered, seems to have a life of its own and almost threatens to take over the painting. The luxurious swirl of cloth, its brilliant sheen, and the way it glimmers and reflects light display Anthony van Dyck's virtuosity as a painter. The family coat of arms seen on the drapery behind the sitter at the left, along with other documented portraits, firmly establishes Pallavicini's identity.",

         "description" : "The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp is a 1632 oil painting by Rembrandt housed in the Mauritshuis museum in The Hague, the Netherlands. Dr. Nicolaes Tulp is pictured explaining the musculature of the arm to medical professionals. Some of the spectators are various doctors who paid commissions to be included in the painting. The painting is signed in the top-left hand corner Rembrant. This may be the first instance of Rembrandt signing a painting with his forename (in its original form) as opposed to the monogramme RHL (Rembrant Harmenszoon of Leiden), and is thus a sign of his growing artistic confidence.",

It is considered one of Velazquez's best artworks. Jan Morris has called it \"one of the most Spanish of all pictures\". The capture of Breda in 1625 was one of the few major successes of Spanish arms in the latter stages of the Eighty Years' War. The Spanish general, the Genoese aristocrat Ambrogio Spinola, conquered Breda in contradiction to the instructions of his superiors. Before its capture the Spanish government had decided that siege warfare of heavily defended towns of the Low Countries was too wasteful and that it would concentrate on the economic blockade of the Dutch republic. The bulk of Spanish forces were diverted to the unfolding vast Thirty Years War.",

The light almost always came from the left, illuminating the face of the woman evenly, and casting striking shadows on that of the man. Hals portrayed the woman - as was usual - in a more static pose than that of the man.",

Quite exceptionally, Frans Hals - from Haarlem - was asked to paint this group portrait. However, he soon found himself at odds with the guardsmen, and the Amsterdam painter Pieter Codde had to step in to finish the seven figures on the right. Known for his small-scale, very smoothly and finely executed works, Codde nevertheless imitated Hals's loose style as best he could.",

         "description" : "Poussin came to Rome in 1624, and only a short stay in Paris (1640-1642) was to interrupt his Roman career. As a friend of his successful fellow-painter Claude Lorrain and a protege of Pope Urban VIII and the cultured members of the papal court, Poussin became one of Rome's most prominent painters. His frequently documented interest in the art of antiquity gave his works a classical touch, which manifests itself in the present painting in its relief-like composition and plain coloration. The chaotic action appears well-organised, with the bodies precisely laid out on the canvas, and the mighty columns of the temple and the rigid figures in the foreground providing a counterweight to the battlefield tumult.",

         "description" : "From 1632 to 1641 van Dyck worked at the court of the English King Charles I, where he produced a marvellous serious of portraits of the English aristocracy, of which this is perhaps one of the most outstanding. Henry Danvers, Earl of Danby (1573-1644), was a member of the Privy Council, Keeper of the Royal Seal and founder of the first botanical garden in England, at Oxford. He was also a renowned military commander, having fought in Ireland, the Southern Netherlands and France. Here, the Earl is seen wearing the attire of a Knight of the Order of the Garter, to which he was elevated in 1633. By his left temple is a black patch, which must cover a scar. The energetic, wilful gesture of the right hand is evidence of his decisiveness, whilst the left hand resting on the sword indicates his watchfulness, necessary to one of the King's inner circle. The elegant pose, the rich picturesqueness of the costume and the luxurious setting give the portrait a very official feel. Combining a true likeness of the sitter with a convincing impression of his character, this painting is also an important historical document.",

         "description" : "Few artists have truly successfully depicted children, but Anthony van Dyck in this portrait of the daughters of Philip, 4th Lord Wharton, produced a genuinely appealing image. It was painted during the late, English period of the artist's career, and is executed well within the traditions of Western European official portraiture. The girls are shown posing statically against a very roughly indicated, generalised background, with just a hint of a decorative landscape. Dressed and coiffed a la mode, they look like true grown up ladies, the eldest holding herself importantly and with a sense of her own importance, just like a lady at court. The youngest gently holds her sister by the shoulder, frozen in the pose in which she has been stood by the artist. The official majesty of the formal portrait is softened by the little dog, surprised by his mistresses' immobility, who scratches wonderingly at the eldest girl's dress with one paw. With its elegant colour scheme, dominated by cold pearly-grey and silver-blue, and the virtuoso skill in conveying the texture of fabrics and jewellery, van Dyck's painting yet manages to be a very gentle and informal image of two charming girls.",

         "description" : "The Rokeby Venus is a painting by Diego Velazquez (1599-1660), the leading artist of the Spanish Golden Age. Completed between 1647 and 1651, and probably painted during the artist's visit to Italy, the work depicts the goddess Venus in a sensual pose, lying on a bed and looking into a mirror held by the Roman god of physical love, her son Cupid. Numerous works, from the ancient to the baroque, have been cited as sources of inspiration for Velazquez. The nude Venuses of the Italian painters, such as Giorgione's Sleeping Venus (c. 1510) and Titian's Venus of Urbino (1538), were the main precedents. In this work, Velazquez combined two established poses for Venus: recumbent on a couch or a bed, and gazing at a mirror. She is often described as looking at herself on the mirror, although this is physically impossible since viewers can see her face reflected in their direction. This phenomenon is known as the Venus effect. In a number of ways the painting represents a pictorial departure, through its central use of a mirror, and because it shows the body of Venus turned away from the observer of the painting.",

Landscape with a Calm does not illustrate a story but rather evokes a mood. The ordered composition and clear, golden light contribute to A Calm's utter tranquility, while glowing, gem-like colors and fluid paint strokes enliven this scene of benevolent nature. Poussin's sketching campaigns in the Roman countryside with his friend and fellow landscape painter Claude Lorrain account, in part, for its fresh observation of cloud-scattered sky and grazing goats.",

         "description" : "Las Meninas (Spanish for The Maids of Honour) is a 1656 painting by Diego Velazquez, the leading artist of the Spanish Golden Age, in the Museo del Prado in Madrid. The work's complex and enigmatic composition raises questions about reality and illusion, and creates an uncertain relationship between the viewer and the figures depicted. Because of these complexities, Las Meninas has been one of the most widely analyzed works in Western painting. The painting shows a large room in the Madrid palace of King Philip IV of Spain, and presents several figures, most identifiable from the Spanish court, captured, according to some commentators, in a particular moment as if in a snapshot. Some look out of the canvas towards the viewer, while others interact among themselves. The young Infanta Margaret Theresa is surrounded by her entourage of maids of honour, chaperone, bodyguard, two dwarfs and a dog. Just behind them, Velazquez portrays himself working at a large canvas. Velazquez looks outwards, beyond the pictorial space to where a viewer of the painting would stand. In the background there is a mirror that reflects the upper bodies of the king and queen. They appear to be placed outside the picture space in a position similar to that of the viewer, although some scholars have speculated that their image is a reflection from the painting Velazquez is shown working on.",

         "description" : "The Milkmaid is an oil-on-canvas painting of a \"milkmaid\", in fact a domestic kitchen maid, by the Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer. It is now in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, Netherlands, which regards it as \"unquestionably one of the museum's finest attractions\". The painting is strikingly illusionistic, conveying not just details but a sense of the weight of the woman and the table. \"The light, though bright, doesn't wash out the rough texture of the bread crusts or flatten the volumes of the maid's thick waist and rounded shoulders\", wrote Karen Rosenberg, an art critic for The New York Times. Yet with half of the woman's face in shadow, it is \"impossible to tell whether her downcast eyes and pursed lips express wistfulness or concentration,\" she wrote.",

         "description" : "Jan Steen arranges the various actors as though on a theatre stage. The gentle depth of the composition is based on a triangle, with the magnificently dressed young woman at its top point. Her clothing and seductive look identify her as a 'loose-living' girl. She, however, is not the focus of the scene; that is provided by the lady of the house, who has fallen asleep at the table on the left. Her 'absence' has resulted in the rest of the story: the dog is finishing the meat pie that was served on the table, one of the children is filching something from the cabinet on the wall ('opportunity makes the thief'), the little girl's brother is trying out a pipe, and the youngest child, sitting in his highchair, is playing carelessly with a string of pearls. His attention diverted to the side, a young man is trying to play a violin. Young people who continued to live at home were considered suspect in the popular culture of the Netherlands at the time. The prostitute in the foreground has already been mentioned: in a provocative gesture she holds a filled glass between the legs of the man of the house, while he dismisses with a grin the admonishment of the nun (a Beguine?) standing on the right. The duck on the shoulder of the man next to her identifies him as a Quaker, who urges the reading of pious texts. Finally, the pig in the doorway to the kitchen is an allusion to another proverb: 'Neither cast ye your pearls [here: roses] before swine'. Hanging above the heads of these sinners are the symbols of the penalty to be expected for unbridled, lustful behaviour: a sword and a crutch in a basket suspended from the ceiling.",

         "description" : " De Hooch painted the present work during his time in Amsterdam (starting in 1660), where he specialised in depicting the style of home furnishings and life typical of the city's well-situated citizens. Despite the presence of a serving maid, the elegantly clad mother is caring personally for her infant; she does not waste money on a wet-nurse. Across the spotless tile floor, we look into a second room at the back, then through the half-open door to a house on a canal and the city beyond. A fire is burning on the hearth, providing a colourful accent that recurs in the infant's clothing and the sunlit view. In a similarly rhythmic fashion, the red of the fabric drying on the hearth is repeated at several points in the picture, giving the composition a balance of colour. This scene makes clear the understanding of (ideal) roles at the time: attentive childcare and a well-run household are a woman's province.",

Today the painting is kept in the Mauritshuis gallery in The Hague. It is sometimes referred to as \"the Mona Lisa of the North\" or \"the Dutch Mona Lisa\". More recent Vermeer literature points to the image being a tronie, the Dutch 17th-century description of a head that was not meant to be a portrait. After the most recent restoration of the painting in 1994, the subtle colour scheme and the intimacy of the girl's gaze toward the viewer have been greatly enhanced.",

         "description" : "The Love Letter is a 17th-century genre painting by Jan Vermeer. The painting shows a servant maid handing a letter to a young woman with a cittern. The tied-up curtain in the foreground creates the impression that the viewer is looking at an intensely private, personal scene. There is also an element of trompe l'oeil as Dutch paintings were often hung with little curtains to conserve them, and the device of painted curtains is seen in other Dutch works of the period. The diagonals on the chequered floor create the impression of depth and three-dimensionality. The fact that it is a love letter that the woman has received is made clear by the fact that she is carrying a lute (more specifically, a cittern, a member of the lute/guitar family). The lute was a symbol of love - often carnal love; luit was also a slang term for vagina. This idea is further reinforced by the slippers at the very bottom of the picture. The removed slipper was another symbol of sex. The floor brush would appear to represent domesticity, and its placement at the side of the painting may suggest that domestic concerns have been forgotten or pushed aside.",

The couple's tender embrace is at the centre of this poignant painting: the man's loving gesture is returned with a gentle caress. The figures and their poses agree with the study (No 67), only the figure of King Abimelech spying on them is missing. We, the viewers, assume his role as witnesses of their clandestine love.",

The expressive freedom of style shows that Rembrandt was certainly not exhausted at the end of his life. The way he painted the face with strong brushstrokes is remarkable. With thick layers of paint that are almost modelled, Rembrandt suggests a man of flesh and blood. This is a true masterpiece.",

         "description" : "Chardin was the first to introduce the themes of the family, motherhood and housework to French 18th-century art. The heroes of Saying Grace belong to the Third Estate, that class of craftsmen and small traders with whose way of life Chardin was most familiar. The action centres on the table where a young mother is dishing out soup and seeking to make her two daughters repeat the words of a lunchtime prayer. Composed with great care, the painting seeks to portray the artist's ideal of the closely-knit family, of their caring attitude towards each other. He produced a warm and touching image in the younger daughter, capturing the feelings of the child who does not as yet fully comprehend the meaning of the words, making it one of the best images of children Chardin ever created.",

In the 1700s, small birds played an important symbolic role in courtship ritual: the gift of a caged bird from a man to a woman signified her capture of his heart. Posed in front of the ruins of a temple to Vesta, young aristocratic women dressed in exquisite finery play with small birds; some still hold them on strings while others daintily hold them on their fingers.",

Venus, located in a lush garden setting, coyly attempts to restrain a pouting Cupid as two putti point to the scene in mocking disapproval. Boucher's success in communicating the charm and sensuality of the nude lies in his mastery of color and fluid brushstrokes. Venus is rendered in porcelain tones, delicately accented in pink, her body highlighted against luscious blue velvet and silk. The two white doves at her feet contrast a thick impasto surface with the transparent water and cool greens and blues of the foliage. The painting exemplifies the rococo love of asymmetric lines and sinuous curves, artfully arranged to seduce both the eye and the mind of the beholder.",

         "description" : "In still lifes, genre scenes, and the occasional portrait, Chardin's skill at rendering the visual and tactile qualities of simple objects won him the admiration of critics like Diderot. In this small still life, Chardin portrayed a modest subject--three walnuts, four peaches, two bunches of grapes, and a pewter mug--but gave the objects monumentality by arranging them in pure geometric groupings and concentrating on their basic forms. He suggested the objects' various textures and substances through the play of light across surfaces and successive applications of paint. In this way, Chardin conveyed the fuzzy skin of the peaches, the hard, brittle shell of the walnuts, the translucence of the grapes, and the heavy, cold exterior of the pewter mug.",

In this portrait he defines the chic of that decade: Madame Bergeret is placed in a garden setting, dressed in a creamy silk gown, tight in the bodice with\r\npuffed sleeves highlighted with blue ribbons. Her face glows with youth and beauty depicted in translucent whites. The most important motif, and the charm of the composition, is the profusion of roses -- emerging from a bronze vase, decorating her sleeves and hair, and arranged across the bench and on the foreground plane. Sacred to Venus, the rose was a symbol well suited for a portrait of Bergeret's beloved wife.",

This work's format and bottom-to-top perspective indicates that it was intended to hang over a window. It's pyramidal composition, with the figures in the foreground, reflects the influence of classical Italian painting on Goya, as well as his mastery at painting light and shadows. The resultant tapestry was intended to hang in the dining room of the Prince and Princess of Asturias (the future Carlos IV and his wife Maria Luisa de Parma) at the Monastery of El Escorial.",

         "description" : "Gainsborough's portrait of this unknown lady is rightly regarded as one of the most charming and excellent works in the Hermitage collection of English painting. Although the artist did not in fact like painting portraits, preferring to work on landscapes, it is for his portraits that he was best loved and is best known today. Here he created an image of great elegance and beauty, a painting dominated by a mood of romantic dreaminess. The light, mobile, melting brushstrokes convey the soft skin, the greyish-blue silk of the shawl, and the luxuriant feather of the headdress which surmounts the powdered wig. Free, sketchy painting is combined with fine transitions of colour to create an effect something akin to pastel. Gainsborough's style was noted and much admired by contemporaries, and even his great rival, the President of the Royal Academy, Sir Joshua Reynolds, admitted his skill.",

         "description" : "Oath of the Horatii (French: Le Serment des Horaces), is a work by French artist Jacques-Louis David painted in 1784. It depicts a scene from a Roman legend about a dispute between two warring cities; Rome and Alba Longa, when three brothers from a Roman family, the Horatii, agree to end the war by fighting three brothers from an Alba Longa family, the Curiatii. The three brothers, all of which appear willing to sacrifice their lives for the good of Rome, are shown saluting their father who holds their swords out for them. The principal sources for the story behind David's Oath are the first book of Livy (sections 24-6) which was elaborated by Dionysius in book 3 of his Roman Antiquities. However, the moment depicted in David's painting is his own invention.",

The sitter, Victoire-Pauline de Riquet de Carama, was an aristocrat and her status improved when she married Jean-Louis, Vicomte de Vaudreuil in 1781. The artist Elisabeth Louise Vigee Le Brun emphasized the Vicomtesse's status and refinement by carefully describing her fashionable straw hat, silk dress, and gauze scarf, collar, and cuffs. Displaying her learning, the Vicomtesse places her right thumb in her book to mark her place, as if she has been interrupted while reading. Vigee Le Brun adopted this obvious gesture, often used in men's portraits, to illustrate women's importance in French Enlightenment circles.",

         "description" : "The Death of Socrates  is an oil on canvas painted by French painter Jacques-Louis David in 1787. The painting focuses on a classical subject like many of his works from that decade, in this case the story of the execution of Socrates as told by Plato in his Phaedo. In this story, Socrates has been convicted of corrupting the youth of Athens and introducing strange gods, and has been sentenced to die by drinking poison hemlock. Socrates uses his death as a final lesson for his pupils rather than fleeing when the opportunity arises, and faces it calmly. The Phaedo depicts the death of Socrates and is also Plato's fourth and last dialogue to detail the philosopher's final days, which is also detailed in Euthyphro, Apology, and Crito.",

The sitter is unknown, but was possibly Reynolds's great-niece Theophila Gwatkin (who was three in 1785), or Lady Anne Spencer (1773-1865), the youngest daughter of the 4th Duke of Marlborough. The picture is a character study, or, in 18th-century terms, a fancy picture, and was painted over another Reynolds work, A Strawberry Girl, perhaps because Strawberry had suffered some paint losses. Only the hands remain in their original state. Innocence itself has deteriorated since 1859. The picture was presented to the National Gallery in 1847 by Robert Vernon, and has hung in the Tate since 1951. The picture became a favourite with the public, and was copied hundreds of times.",

         "description" : "Corsican by birth, Moltedo was an enterprising businessman and inventor, agent to the French clergy at the Vatican, and director of the Roman post office from 1803 until 1814. Painted during one of the most productive periods of Ingres's nascent career, this refined portrait belongs to a series of commissions he received from French officials in Napoleonic Rome. They are distinguished by the inclusion of Roman views as backdrops-in this case the Appian Way and the Colosseum-as well as by stormy gray skies, a Romantic conceit that serves as a foil to the calm and secure expressions of the men portrayed.",

A woman personifying Liberty leads the people forward over the bodies of the fallen, holding the tricolor flag of the French Revolution in one hand and brandishing a bayonetted musket with the other. The painting is perhaps Delacroix's best-known work.",

Kruseman admired English portraiture. The rural set-ting with a hunting dog and a garden vase is derived from English models.",

It is winter, and all around him nature is dying. Leafless trees loom behind like specters, but a grove of verdant oaks rises through the mist in the background with the promise of life. The waxing moon, high in the sky, also acts as a counterbalance to death, symbolizing Christ and the promise of rebirth for the artist Caspar David Friedrich.",

Pauline de Broglie sat for the artist's final commission. Ingres captures the shy reserve of his subject while illuminating through seamless brushwork the material quality of her many fine attributes: her rich blue satin and lace ball gown, the gold embroidered shawl, and silk damask chair, together with finely tooled jewels of pearl, enamel, and gold. The portrait was commissioned by the sitter's husband, Albert de Broglie, a few years after their ill-fated marriage. Pauline was stricken with tuberculosis soon after completion of the exquisite portrait, leaving five sons and a grieving husband. Through Albert's lifetime, it was draped in fabric on the walls of the family residence.",

         "description" : "Delacroix took the subject for this painting from his recollections of the journey through Morocco in 1832. In the foreground he depicted two hunters - a man and a youth - beneath the luxurious crown of a tree, as well as two Arabs in the background with a horse. The outlines of the figures and the rock, the twisted trunks of the trees create a sense of tension. The rifle in the hands of one of the hunters and the unsheathed sabre lying on the ground emphasize that things are coming to an end. The dramatism so typical of Romanticism is created here by energetic brushstrokes and the contrast of complementary colours - red and green, blue and orange - and light and dark patches: the dark green foliage and shaded rock seem to be more tangible in contrast with the sky and the mountain stream.",

It proved an immediate and resounding success both for its patriotic values and for the medieval inspiration of the subject, typical of the Romantic taste of the time: Hayez painted other versions of it, now in various European collections.",

It is believed that the artist drew each of the figures individually, later combining them in this unique portrayal of their family dynamic. The woman, Degas' aunt Laura, wears a black dress in mourning for her recently deceased father, whose portrait hangs on the wall behind her. It is likely that this portrait hung at the Paris Salon of 1867, but it was badly hung and as a result was largely ignored by the critics. As a result, Degas kept it in his personal collection, where it remained until he left it to his dealer in 1913. In 1918, after his death, it was revealed an exhibition of the artist's estate, and was immediately bought for 400,000 by the Luxembourg Museum.",

The work shows a woman in full figure standing on a wolf skin in front of a white curtain with a lily in her hand. The colour scheme of the painting is almost entirely white. The model is Joanna Heffernan, the artist's mistress. Though the painting was originally called The White Girl, Whistler later started calling it Symphony in White, No. 1. By referring to his work in such abstract terms, he intended to emphasise his \"art for art's sake\" philosophy.",

         "description" : "An academic painter who had achieved great success in the Paris Salon with mythological, historical, and religious subjects, Bouguereau later turned to genre scenes such as this image of a young woman caring for her younger brother. Although the figures are defined as siblings in the title, Bouguereau evokes the Madonna and Child with a tender pose-much like that seen in the altarpieces on the opposite wallÔÇöand the Catholic rosary beads in the child's hand. Moreover, scholars have linked Bouguereau's composition and the dark, dreamy look of the girl to the Sistine Madonna by Raphael. Bouguereau's works appealed to a middle-class clientele-both French and American-that cherished Christian and domestic values.",

It is a large work painted en plein air; the size of the canvas necessitated Monet painting its upper half with the canvas lowered into a trench he had dug, so that he could maintain a single point of view for the entire work. The setting is the garden of a property he was renting. His companion Camille posed for the figures. Monet finished the work indoors, and used magazine illustrations to render fashionable clothing",

         "description" : "When Manet painted this piece, scenes of bourgeois life were in vogue. Yet The Balcony went against the conventions of the day. All the subjects were close acquaintances of the artist, especially Berthe Morisot who here, pictured sitting in the foreground, makes her first appearance in Manet's work, and who went on to become one of his favourite models. The painting tells no story or anecdote; the protagonists are frozen, as if isolated in an interior dream, evidence that Manet was freeing himself from academic constraints, despite the obvious reference to Goya's Majas at the Balcony.",

         "description" : "Portrait of Madame Cezanne with Loosened Hair (or Madame Cezanne with Unbound Hair) is an oil-on-canvas painting by French artist Paul Cezanne, variously dated from the mid 1870s to the early 1890s. Although the model, his wife Hortense Fiquet, was not supportive and did not understand or take an interest her husband's work, this is one of forty-four portraits in which she sat for him from 1869, a period during which she progressed from mistress, to wife, to ex-wife. Something of a socialite, Cezanne latterly found Fiquet often fickle and shallow, and once remarked, \"My wife only cares for Switzerland and lemonade\". The sensitivity and depth ascribed to her in this work, is likely drawn from his own personality, projected onto her image.",

From the faithfully copied British racing print to the stylishly attired female protagonist, it recalls the work of fellow artist James Tissot. Yet for all the exacting detail, the subject of this picture remains elusive. The model's elegant visiting dress, curiously worn without a hat, and the informality of her pose may suggest a familial or intimate relationship, but Degas offers faint clue as to the cause of his \"sulking.\"",

         "description" : "While his figure paintings are better known, Renoir's landscapes resonate with a vigor and freshness of vision central to the development of impressionism, most apparent here in his transcription of the effects of sunlight. Midday sun suffuses the panorama, its intensity heightening the artist's palette and suppressing incidental detail to clarify the crowded scene. Painted in the wake of the Franco–Prussian War and ensuing civil strife that had devastated France in 1870 and 1871, Renoir's 1872 image shows a representative sampling of French citizenry crossing the oldest bridge in Paris, the intact heart of the recovering country.",

Some twenty-four women, ballerinas and their mothers, wait while a dancer executes an \"attitude\" for her examination. Jules Perrot, a famous ballet master, conducts the class. The imaginary scene is set in a rehearsal room in the old Paris Opera, which had recently burned to the ground. On the wall beside the mirror, a poster for Rossini's Guillaume Tell pays tribute to the singer Jean-Baptiste Faure, who commissioned the picture and lent it to the 1876 Impressionist exhibition.",

Up close, however, each dab of paint is distinct, and the scene dissolves into a mosaic of paint—brilliant, unblended tones of blue, red, green, yellow. In the water, quick, fluid skips of the brush mimic the lapping surface. In the trees, thicker paint is applied with denser, stubbier strokes. The figure in the sailboat is only a ghostly wash of dusty blue, the women rowing nearby are indicated by mere shorthand.",

         "description" : "Woman with a Parasol was painted outdoors, probably in a single session of several hours' duration. The artist intended the work to convey the feeling of a casual family outing rather than a formal portrait, and used pose and placement to suggest that his wife and son interrupted their stroll while he captured their likenesses. The brevity of the moment portrayed here is conveyed by a repertory of animated brushstrokes of vibrant color, hallmarks of the style Monet was instrumental in forming. Bright sunlight shines from behind Camille to whiten the top of her parasol and the flowing cloth at her back, while colored reflections from the wildflowers below touch her front with yellow.",

         "description" : "Dance at Moulin de la Galette is one of Impressionism's most highly revered masterpieces. The scene is of a Sunday afternoon at Moulin de la Galette, where Parisians would typically dress up and spend all day dancing, drinking, and eating galettes, or flat cakes. The painting was in the collection of Gustave Caillebotte, but it was claimed by the French government upon his death due to the non payment of death duties. It was later transferred from the Luxembourg Museum, to the Louvre, and then later to the Musee d'Orsay. Its sale price at auction in 2009 was the fifth highest price ever paid for a painting at auction.",

Here, however, Mauve depicted the other side of that fishing village: the sunny world of the well-to-do bourgeoisie. Three riders descend to the beach, where the bathing cabins stand ready for swimmers. The blond and blue colour scheme effectively conveys the briny atmosphere of a summer day along the seashore.",

         "description" : "Arnold Bocklin spent the autumn of 1879 on Ischia. The Castello Alfonso, on a small island nearby, deeply impressed him during his stay. When the young, widowed Marie Berna visited Bocklin's studio in Florence in 1880 and asked for a 'picture to dream by,' the memory of that landscape must have merged with earlier memories of, for example, the islands of the dead like San Michele in Venice and Etruscan cliff-necropolises. The Isle of the Dead became one of Bocklin's most popular pictorial works. He achieved this by combining a limited number of ideas into an impressive atmospheric composition. The motifs - island, water, and castle or villa by the sea - are already familiar from many of his earlier works. However, in this case they have been concentrated into a statement of the artist's Weltanschauung. The location is sinister. The viewer's gaze is led up the steps but can penetrate no further into the darkness. The island's strict symmetry, the calm horizontals and verticals, the circular island surrounded by high cliff walls, and the magical lighting create an atmosphere that is both solemn and sublime, evoking a sense of stillness and other-worldliness. The ripple-less surface of the water and the boat bearing the coffin with a figure shrouded in white behind it add a melancholy tone to the whole.",

         "description" : "Bathers at Asnieres is an oil-on-canvas painting by the French artist Georges-Pierre Seurat, the first of his two masterpieces on the monumental scale. Seurat borrowed from sources such as those of the fresco painters of the 15th century, the French classicism of Nicolas Poussin, and of contemporary Impressionism to create a unified canvas of a suburban, but placid Parisian riverside scene. The isolated figures and their clothes piled sculpturally on the riverbank, together with the trees, and austere boundary walls and buildings, are presented in a formal layout. A combination of complex brushstroke techniques, and a meticulous application of contemporary colour theory bring to the composition a sense of gentle vibrancy and timelessness.",

         "description" : "Renoir likely painted this work in his studio, posing his model and future wife, Aline Charigot, in a wicker chair. The beach behind her probably represents the Normandy coast near Dieppe. This canvas reflects the impact of Renoir's trip to Italy in 1881-82, which inspired him to unite the 'grandeur and simplicity' he admired in Renaissance art with the luminosity of Impressionism. His new approach, which he called his 'dry' manner, is evident in Aline's face, with its carefully drawn features and smooth handling of paint. The medley of quick strokes in the background, however, displays the freer technique of Renoir's earlier years.",

         "description" : "It was Edgar Degas who invited Cassatt to participate in the impressionist exhibitions, and the two remained close associates. Degas respected Cassatt's work, seeing in her careful compositions an approach to art that was deliberate and well thought out. Degas was known for his sharp criticism of other artists' work. He once complained to Cassatt: \"What do women know about style?\" She took his words as a challenge to produce a work whose appeal derived, not from a conventionally pretty subject, but purely from artifice, the painter's skill, and style. This painting is the result.",

         "description" : "Most of the second half of Monet's life was spent in and around Giverny, where the leader of the Impressionists was particularly drawn by the landscape of central France. He captured views of Giverny in numerous canvases. A year before he painted this work in 1886, Monet had already shown a field of poppies (\"Poppy Field\", 1885; Paul Mellon Collection, USA), but without the haystack. The Hermitage work is one of the first of his paintings to show the haystack, which was to be the subject of whole series of works. Monet in virtuoso style captures the fine nuances of effects of light and air, picking the very moment at which the weather is changing and the horizon brightening on an overcast, windy day. The Impressionists painted such overcast weather with bright, light colours, which enabled them to capture the translucent sky and bring out the endlessly rich nuances of colour.",

This is Seurat's first nocturnal painting and his first depiction of popular entertainment. It represents the parade, or sideshow, of the Circus Corvi, which had set up near the place de la Nation in Paris in the spring of 1887. Sideshows were held on the street, for free, to entice passersby to purchase tickets. The onlookers at the far right are queued on stairs leading to the box office.",

         "description" : "Tennyson's poem, first published in 1832, tells of a woman who suffers under an undisclosed curse. She lives isolated in a tower on an island called Shalott, on a river which flows down from King Arthur's castle at Camelot. Not daring to look upon reality, she is allowed to see the outside world only through its reflection in a mirror. One day she glimpses the reflected image of the handsome knight Lancelot, and cannot resist looking at him directly. The mirror cracks from side to side, and she feels the curse come upon her. The punishment that follows results in her drifting in her boat downstream to Camelot singing her last song, but dying before she reaches there.",

This Decoration had no pre-defined form or size; the central idea of the Decoration grew step by step, with the progress of his work. Starting with the Sunflowers, portraits were included in the next step. Finally, mid-September 1888, the idea took shape: from this time on he concentrated on size 30 canvases (Toiles de 30), which were all meant to form part of this Decoration",

The earlier series executed in Paris in 1887 gives the flowers lying on the ground, while the second set executed a year later in Arles shows bouquets of sunflowers in a vase.",

This series is unique in many ways. Although Van Gogh loved to paint portraits, it was difficult for financial and other reasons for him to find models. So, finding an entire family that agreed to sit for paintings, in fact for several sittings each was a bounty.\r\nJoseph Roulin became a particularly good, loyal and supporting friend to Van Gogh during his stay in Arles. To represent a man he truly admired was important to him. The family, with children ranging in age from four months to seventeen years, also gave him the opportunity to produces works of individuals in several different stages of life.\r\nRather than making photographic-like works, Van Gogh used his imagination, colors and themes artistically and creatively to evoke desired emotions from the audience.",

This painting also incorporates elements from his Christ series, which also place Breton French women alongside a Biblical scene, placing them as observers in the story. In his typical style, flat areas of color are outlined by thick black lines, and the figures are void of any shading or depth of color.",

         "description" : "This self–portrait is a particularly bold painting, apparently executed in a single sitting without later retouching. Here Van Gogh portrayed himself at work, dressed in his artist's smock with his palette and brushes in hand, a guise he had already adopted in two earlier self–portraits. While the pose itself and the intense scrutiny of the artist's gaze are hardly unique—one need but think of the occasionally uncompromising self–portraits of Rembrandt—the haunting and haunted quality of the image is distinct. The dark blue–violet of the smock and ground, the vivid orange of his hair and beard, create a startling contrast to the yellow and green of his face and heighten the gauntness of his features in a sallow complexion. The dynamic, even frenzied brushwork lends an uncommon immediacy and expressiveness to his portrayal.",

The Starry Night was the view from the window in Van Gogh's sanitarium bedroom. Although it is a night scene, it was painted during the day. The painting is often referred to as Van Gogh's magnus opus. As he often sent his works to his brother Theo for his approval, he mailed this one to him in late 1889. He also wrote that he was not so happy about the work, which did not seem complete, as he had originally intended it to simply be a study of the night sky.",

         "description" : "In May 1889, after episodes of self-mutilation and hospitalization, Vincent van Gogh chose to enter an asylum in Saint-Remy, France. There, in the last year before his death, he created almost 130 paintings. Within the first week, he began Irises, working from nature in the asylum's garden. The cropped composition, divided into broad areas of vivid color with monumental irises overflowing its borders, was probably influenced by the decorative patterning of Japanese woodblock prints. Each one of Van Gogh's irises is unique. He carefully studied their movements and shapes to create a variety of curved silhouettes bounded by wavy, twisting, and curling lines. The painting's first owner, French art critic Octave Mirbeau, one of Van Gogh's earliest supporters, wrote: \"How well he has understood the exquisite nature of flowers!\"",

In this way, he demonstrated that it was possible to create an image with numerous variations of a single colour, without any loss of eloquence.",

It depicts a yellow form of Christ being crucified in 19th century northern France. French Breton women gather around the cross in prayer. The only shading in the painting is of the women bowed in prayer, the figure of Christ on the cross clearly outlined in black, and his form is flat, typical of the Gaugin's symbolic style.",

Very somber, mountainous background and flowering trees . . . a dark violet path and an emerald green foreground, with bananas on the left.

         "description" : "The monumental stacks that Claude Monet depicted in his series Stacks of Wheat rose fifteen to twenty feet and stood just outside the artist's farmhouse at Giverny. Through 1890 and 1891, he worked on this series both in the field, painting simultaneously at several easels, and in the studio, refining pictorial harmonies. In May 1891, Monet hung fifteen of these canvases next to each other in one small room in the Galerie Durand-Ruel in Paris. An unprecedented critical and financial success, the exhibition marked a breakthrough in Monet's career, as well as in the history of French art.",

         "description" : "In late 1891 or early 1892 Renoir was invited by the French government to execute a painting for a new museum in Paris, the Musee du Luxembourg, which was to be devoted to the work of living artists. He chose as his subject two girls at the piano. Aware of the intense scrutiny to which his submission would be subjected, Renoir lavished extraordinary care on this project, developing and refining the composition in a series of five canvases. The Lehman painting and the nearly identical version formerly in the collection of Renoir's fellow Impressionist Gustave Caillebotte have long been regarded as the most accomplished variants of this intimate and engaging scene of bourgeois domestic life.",

The prototypes for such figures appeared in the paintings of the Old Masters back in the 17th century, but here there is no subject, no narrative interest. Nor is there any sense of a genre, despite the prosaic nature of the motif. The calm, solid pose, the generalised face without any gestures or expression, the monumental figure, all give the image a classical majesty. The integrity of human nature is captured in three-dimensional forms.",

Peasants dance the farandole, a popular southern French dance, around three liberty trees and two female figures representing the First and Third Republics. Rousseau copied the dancers from a French magazine illustration but added waving banners, the liberty poles, and the allegorical figures. A wagon in the background is full of costumed musicians, reminiscent of parades the artist had seen. He used brilliant colors and solid forms to express the happiness of the scene symbolizing good government. To the right, the erect posture of the dignified republican leaders signals the solidity of the French Republic.",

To the right stands an aunt, Karen Bjolstad, who moved in with the family to take care of the children and the household after the mother died of tuberculosis in 1868. In the background stands the father, the doctor Christian Munch, with his hands clasped as if in prayer. Near the centre of the picture is a male figure, probably Edvard, in quarter-face. Sister Laura is sitting in the foreground with her hands in her lap, while the third sister, Inger, stands staring straight at us. The male figure to the left is generally identified as Edvard's younger brother Andreas. In Death in the SickRoom there is no physical contact between the people, except for the hand that aunt Karen has laid on the back of the chair in which the invalid sits.",

The dark figure of the man compresses the picture onto the flat plane of the canvas, and the horizon is pushed to the top, collapsing a sense of distance. Our higher vantage point gives us an oblique view into the boat. Its form is divided into decorative shapes by the intersection of its horizontal supports.",

         "description" : "Gauguin returned from his first stay in Tahiti (1891-1893) to spend nearly two years in Paris, where he painted this work. The exotic world of Oceania had captured the artist's imagination with its harmony of man and nature, with what he saw as the preservation of primitive simplicity. This work captures his recollections of Tahiti and his romantic dreams of the harmony of all on earth. The Tahitian girls symbolise different stages in life. The young islander with the halo above her head, deep in sleep, is the embodiment of virgin purity, while the second girl with the fruit in her hand, ready to take a bite, is like Eve. In the depths of the landscape islanders are dancing around an idol, some mysterious ancient god. The canvas reveals the artist's very individual style with its pure colours applied in generalised flat areas which, like the lines, are subjugated to a single rhythm.",

Lawrence Alma-Tadema here represented the Victorian custom of sending children into the country to collect flowers on the morning of May 1, or May Day, but placed the scene in ancient Rome. In this way, he suggested the festival's great antiquity through architectural details, dress, sculpture, and even the musical instruments based on Roman originals.",

A lion chances to pass by, picks up her scent yet does not devour her. There is a moonlight effect, very poetic. A toll collector for the city of Paris, Rousseau was a largely self-taught painter, although he had ambitions of entering the Academy. This goal was never realized, but his sharp colors, fantastic imagery, and precise outlines-derived from the style and subject matter of popular print culture struck a chord with a younger generation of avant-garde painters, including Pablo Picasso, Vasily Kandinsky, and Frida Kahlo.",

In Tahiti, as he was painting his masterpiece, Gaugin declared that he would commit suicide upon its completion. Although this was something he had previously attempted, this was not the case, as the artist died of syphilis in 1903. The painting was meant to be read from right to left, with the three main figures in the painting representing the three questions of the title. The figures are arranged from the beginning stages of life, from young figures with a child, to the middle aged figure in the middle, to the elder figure on the left of the painting. The idol in the background, situated behind the elder figure, represents the Beyond.",

The painting is the largest of a series of \"Bather\" paintings by Cezanne; the others are in the Museum of Modern Art in New York City and the National Gallery, London. Occasionally referred to as the Big Bathers or Large Bathers to distinguish it from the smaller works, the painting is considered one of the masterpieces of modern art, and is often considered Cezanne's finest work. Cezanne worked on the painting for seven years, and it remained unfinished at the time of his death in 1906. The painting was purchased in 1937 for $110,000 with funds from a trust fund for the Philadelphia Museum of Art by their major benefactor Joseph E. Widener. It was previously owned by Leo Stein.",

The central element of the composition is a couple, of whom the woman is wearing a bright red dress that wraps itself around the feet of her dancing partner. Her loose hair swirling about him, they seem to become a single entity. This couple is flanked by two other women, one of them young and radiant in a white dress, the other pale, with sunken cheeks and dressed in black. It is as if a story were being told about various stages in a woman's life. Munch has set the scene on the seashore, a landscape with elements from Asgardstrand. Many of the pictures in Munch's protracted Frieze of Life project were inspired by Asgardstrand's curving shoreline and characteristic landscape.",

From his room at the Savoy Hotel, he painted Waterloo Bridge to the east, and Charing Cross Bridge to the west; beginning in February 1900, he set up his easel on a terrace at Saint Thomas's Hospital across the river, reserving time in the late afternoon to depict the Houses of Parliament.\r\n\r\nWhile in London, Monet produced nearly a hundred canvases, reportedly moving from one to another as the light changed. He continued to work on these paintings in his studio at Giverny. In May 1904, thirty-seven were exhibited at the Galerie Durand-Ruel in Paris, including this view of the Houses of Parliament cloaked in dense fog.",

Using vivid, apparently arbitrary, colours, Matisse has captured the sensation of sunlight striking the sitter's face and casting a heavy shadow down one side. He has also tried to create a dynamic but balanced relationship between complementary colours, such as blue and orange, red and green. Complementary colours 'complete' each other: they are at their most intense when placed together. Matisse adjusted his colours to obtain the maximum intensity. This non-naturalistic use of colour can be seen as a radical development of certain aspects of Impressionist art, and it led the critics to dub Matisse a 'fauve' (wild beast).",

Its absence attests to the notion that creative genius is not simply manual dexterity but the expression of an inner vision, here symbolized by the artist's intense, staring eyes.",

Their older brother Michael Stein and his wife Sarah also became collectors of his work. Picasso painted portraits of both Gertrude Stein and her nephew Allan Stein. Gertrude Stein became Picasso's principal patron, acquiring his drawings and paintings and exhibiting them in her informal Salon at her home in Paris. At one of her gatherings in 1905, he met Henri Matisse, who was to become a lifelong friend and rival. The Steins introduced him to Claribel Cone and her sister Etta who were American art collectors; they also began to acquire Picasso and Matisse's paintings. Eventually Leo Stein moved to Italy, and Michael and Sarah Stein became patrons of Matisse; while Gertrude Stein continued to collect Picasso.",

         "description" : "The terracotta shades and heavy monumentality of the figures in <em>Two Nudes</em> derive from Picasso's interest at the time in the ancient Iberian sculpture of his native Spain. Like many artists in the first decades of the twentieth century, Picasso found ancient and non-western art to be fruitful alternatives both to the prescribed forms of academic painting and the visual culture of industrial modernity. These two women are nearly mirror images, but the face of the figure on the left bears a strong resemblance to that of the figure on the far left in <em>Les Demoiselles d'Avignon</em>. Like the woman in Demoiselles, with whom she shares her chiseled nose and dark, hollow eyes, this woman holds open what appears to be a curtain and gazes outward, as though beckoning viewers in.",

         "description" : "Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (The Young Ladies of Avignon, and originally titled The Brothel of Avignon) is a large oil painting of 1907 by the Spanish artist Pablo Picasso (1881-1973). The work portrays five nude female prostitutes from a brothel in Barcelona. Each figure is depicted in a disconcerting confrontational manner and none are conventionally feminine. The women appear as slightly menacing and rendered with angular and disjointed body shapes. Two are shown with African mask-like faces and three more with faces in the Iberian style of Picasso's native Spain, giving them a savage aura. In this adaptation of Primitivism and abandonment of perspective in favor of a flat, two-dimensional picture plane, Picasso makes a radical departure from traditional European painting. The work is widely considered to be seminal in the early development of both cubism and modern art. Demoiselles was revolutionary and controversial, and led to wide anger and disagreement, even amongst his closest associates and friends.",

He began work on it in 1907 and it is the highpoint of his so-called 'Golden Period', when he painted a number of works in a similar style. It depicts a couple embracing, their bodies largely hidden by elaborate robes decorated in a style that bears little relation to any historical textile designs. As well as conventional oil paint, gold leaf has been used, one of the aspects of the work that gives it a strikingly modern appearance, while evoking memories of much earlier art. The painting is now in the Aûsterreichische Galerie Belvedere museum, in the Belvedere palace, in Vienna, Austria.",

         "description" : "Although Rousseau completed more than twenty-five jungle paintings in his career, he never traveled outside France. He instead drew on images of the exotic as it was presented to the urban dweller through popular literature, colonial expositions, and the Paris Zoo. The lush jungle, wild animals, and mysterious horn player featured in this work were inspired by Rousseau's visits to the city's natural history museum and Jardin des plantes (a combined zoo and botanical garden). Of his visits the artist said, \"When I am in these hothouses and see the strange plants from exotic lands, it seems to me that I am entering a dream.\" The nude model in this painting reclines on a sofa, mixing the domestic and the exotic.",

The large work, painted along the lines of William Blake's painting Oberon, Titania and Puck with Fairies Dancing, was painted along with its companion piece, Music, which depicts nudes playing music in a similar setting. The pieces were specially created for Russian businessman and art collector Sergei Shchukin, who was a long-time associate of Matisse's. This painting is often recognized as a key point in the development of Matisse's artwork, as well as in the development of modern painting. It is also often associated with Dance of the Young Girls, in The Rite of Spring by Igor Stravinsky.",

         "description" : "Death and Life is an oil on canvas painting by Austrian symbolist painter, Gustav Klimt whose primary subject was the female body. His paintings, murals, and sketches are marked by a sensual eroticism, which is especially apparent in his pencil drawings. The painting was started in 1908 and completed in 1915. It is created in an Art Nouveau (Modern) style by use of allegorical painting genre during Golden phase. This is one of Klimt’s central themes, central also to his time and to his contemporaries among them Edvard Munch and Egon Schiele. Klimt makes of it a modern dance of death, but unlike Schiele, he introduces a note of hope and reconciliation, instead of feeling threatened by the figure of death, his human beings seem to disregard it.",

In the village, peasants and animals lived side by side, in a mutual dependence here signified by the line from peasant to cow, connecting their eyes. The peasant's flowering sprig, symbolically a tree of life, is the reward of their partnership. For Hasids, animals were also humanity's link to the universe, and the painting's large circular forms suggest the orbiting sun, moon (in eclipse at the lower left), and earth.",

         "description" : "This self-portrait is one of the most popular in Schiele's work. The artist has squeezed himself into a horizontal format, cropping the chest and hair. The head turns to the right although his eyes look in the other direction. This evokes a strong sense of tension in the picturek which is carried through to the sitter's surroundings. the twig with leaves and Chinese lanterns on the left of the picture echoes the inclined head while the slanting shoulders create a slight contrast to the rigidly structured background. The lines within the main forms are also in tune with the outstanding composition. Note, for example, the line of the shoulder on the right, which is continued by the jawbone. Schiele's use of colour is also on a par with his sensitive drawing. Striking features include the rich nuances of the skin and the light eye with the red pupil. In this portrait Schiele depicted himself as a sensitive person and artist.",

         "description" : "Abandoning objectivity in a depiction and immersing himself in “the resonance of colour and shape”, Kandinsky successfully came up with three types of abstract painting. Impressions, born under the influence of the outside world, and improvisations, reflecting inner emotional experience, were created in isolation from figurativeness, but still retained a link with reality. It was in the third type of painting, compositions, that Kandinsky’s long years of creative searching found their fullest expression. The essence of the artist’s creative work shifted into the expressiveness of line and colours that are not connected with the world of objects and are directed to the sphere of emotions and sensations. The starting point for Composition VI was a picture on glass called The Flood that the artist sought to rethink. An inner sense of catastrophe, expressed in an abstract form, is the content of the canvas.",

The related Abstract Speed and Abstract Speed The Car Has Passed would have been the flanking panels. Indications of sky and a single landscape are present in the three paintings; the interpretation of fragmented evocations of the car's speed varies from panel to panel. The Peggy Guggenheim work is distinguished by crisscross motifs, representing sound, and a multiplication of the number of lines and planes.",

         "description" : "Viewed from the castle hill at Krumau, this curved cluster of houses can be precisely identified. To make them stand out clearly, the painter omitted the houses in the background and the bridge and opposite bank with St Jodocus’s Church. His concern was not to represent the topography, but to draw, with a cubist touch, a maze-like network of angular lines whose compositional center is located on the island-like peninsula. With their different components of façades, roofs, and chimneys, the buildings have the appearance of stereometric structures. Green and lilac bands follow the exterior of the houses in tune to themselves and to each other, like voices in a fugue. The sense of movement in this crescent is enhanced by the row of autumnal trees. Like the linear boundaries between land and dark water, all of the trees and structures of the land have been composed into a bow shape, which thereby adds to the spatial tug of the block of buildings.",

         "description" : "Klee loved the tales of the German poet and writer E. T. A. Hoffmann (1776-1822), who was nicknamed \"Ghost Hoffmann\" in his own country. Tale à la Hoffmann appears to be loosely based on the poet's best-known lyrical tale, The Golden Pot (1814), a magical story that switches back and forth between high fantasy and everyday life in Dresden. It recounts the trials of the pure and foolish young Anselmus and his efforts to gain entry to Atlantis, the heaven of poetry. The tree from which Anselmus first heard fateful voices speaking to him might thus be on the left. The odd, tubelike construction on the right perhaps represents the glass bottle in which Anselmus found himself briefly imprisoned. The tale's repeated references to time are reflected in the two clocks, and the vessel in the center may stand for the golden pot with the fantastic lily that gives the story its name.",

Although it was conjectured that the soft melting watches were the result of Dali's interpretation of the theory of relativity, Dali himself state that their inspiration was camembert cheese melting under the sun. The sequence of melting clocks in a disjointed landscape is the depiction of a dream that Dali had experienced, the figure in the middle of the painting being the face of the dreamer himself. The general interpretation is that the painting, which portrays many melting watches, is a rejection of time as a solid and deterministic influence.",

Her white-haloed profile, rendered in a smooth lavender pink, appears serene. But it merges with a more roughly painted, frontal view of her face-a crescent, like the moon, yet intensely yellow, like the sun, and \"made up\" with a gilding of rouge, lipstick, and green eye-shadow.

         "description" : "Mondrian, who had escaped to New York from Europe after the outbreak of World War II, delighted in the city's architecture. He was also fascinated by American jazz, particularly boogie-woogie, finding its syncopated beat, irreverent approach to melody, and improvisational aesthetic akin to what he called, in his own work, the \"destruction of natural appearance; and construction through continuous opposition of pure meansÔÇödynamic rhythm.\" In this painting, his penultimate, Mondrian replaced the black grid that had long governed his canvases with predominantly yellow lines that intersect at points marked by squares of blue and red. These atomized bands of stuttering chromatic pulses, interrupted by light gray, create paths across the canvas suggesting the city's grid, the movement of traffic, and blinking electric lights, as well as the rhythms of jazz.",
